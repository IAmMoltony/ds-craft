plans for future updates

1. better localization

the game could have localization files in nitroFS with the following format:

title_play Play
title_settings Settings
title_credits Credits
# and so on...

and yes it will support comments

and for the russian strings which have to be converted because of the way i set up the fonts, the function for extracting string from
localization file could have built in string encoding. strencode.py will no longer be necessary!

2. more mobs

at least cows. this way you will be able to milk them and uhh well rn it will not do anything but still will be pretty fun

3. break/place block hand animations

4. furnaces

5. day night cycle

this would require a lighting system. i tried to implement a lighting system before, but the method i used was SUPER inefficient.
however, i have thought of an algorithm that might just do the job.

6. lighting

after scratching my head for about 10 minutes, i remembered that c++ has something called a map. the map's key can be a std::pair of 2 numbers,
representing the coordinates. then we copy the block pointer pointers into the map, and iterate through it.

so it will look like this [pseudocode]:

void calculateLighting(BlockList &blocks) {
	std::map<Block::Position, Block::Pointer *> blocksMap;
	for (block in blocks) {
		blocksMap[block.getPosition()] = &block;
	}

	for (block in blocksMap) {
		block.calculateLighting(blocksMap);
	}

	// and we don't even need to copy anything back into the blocks vector
}
