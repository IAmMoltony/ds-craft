plans for beta1.2

1. better localization

the game could have localization files in nitroFS with the following format:

title_play Play
title_settings Settings
title_credits Credits
# and so on...

and yes it will support comments

and for the russian strings which have to be converted because of the way i set up the fonts, the function for extracting string from
localization file could have built in string encoding. strencode.py will no longer be necessary!

2. more mobs

at least cows. this way you will be able to milk them and uhh well rn it will not do anything but still will be pretty fun

3. break/place block hand animations
