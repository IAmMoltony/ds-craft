Adding new textures

Textures in `gfx`: copy one of the other textures' .grit file and paste the png of the texture into gfx/

PCX textures (nitro:/textures/):

On Linux, open the image in GIMP and save it as PCX in the textures folder. Then use ImageMagick's convert
tool like this:

convert texture.pcx -colors 256 texture.pcx

..Where "texture.pcx" is the name of the texture

On Windows, you can use IrfanView to convert the image. Here's how to do it:

1. Open the PNG/BMP/JPG/whatever in IrfanView
2. Decrease or increase color depth to 256 colors (8bpp). The button to do that is somewhere in the menu bar on the top.
3. Save as PCX
4. profit :p
