Loot tables!

Loot tables are basically arrays of chest states.
Example of loot table file:

apple 1 3 3
STATE
bread 3 0 3

This loot table defines 2 states.
The first contains one apple at position 3,3
The second contains three bread at position 0,3

A loot table can have as many states as needed. Even just one.
All chest cells that are not described get filled with null-items (zero of none).

When a loot table is applied to a chest, the chest gets wiped and one of the loot table's states gets applied.

Each state starts with a line that reads `STATE'. It's only there for separating states.
Note: the first state has to not start with `STATE'.

Items have the folliwing syntax:

ItemID Count PosX PosY

ItemID: item ID
Count: how many items there should be in the cell
PosX: zero-based X position of the cell that the item should be placed in.
PosY: same as PosX but for Y position

If ItemID is invalid, PosX is greater than 9 or PosY is greater than 9, then an error will occur.
